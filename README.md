# Network game Onitama

Onitama is a Japanese turn-based and card game that is based on martial arts philosophy. At first glance it resembles chess - it is a two-player game where both players take turns moving their pieces around the game board. Both players have four student pieces (pawn) and one master piece (king). At the start of the game, 5 game cards are randomly selected from the 16 cards in the deck as follows: two for the black player, two for the white player and one free card. The game continues with only these 5 cards. In this game, it does not matter that both players can see each other's cards, as they play with the cards face up at all times.

The white player starts the game by choosing one of his two cards and, in combination with a piece, draws anywhere on the game board. If he has no square to drag to, he may also select a card and skip his turn. The played card is now replaced with the middle free card and his turn ends. Next, the black player continues in the same way, and so on. The game ends when one player takes the master piece from his opponent. The game also ends if one player succeeds in getting the master piece to the starting position of the opponent's master
